<h1>EatQuik</h1>

EatQuik is a food delivery platform developed in Windows Forms that is similiar to UberEats. Most of the work done here is on the backend, since it was developed on a Database course at Universidade de Aveiro.

It features most of the available SQL programming methods, such as UDFs, stored procedures and index.
